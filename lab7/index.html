		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>My biggest challenge with this lab was figuring out how changes to the CSS
		affect the style of the page. I played around with different properties like
		width measurements, colors, and fonts while continuously checking the browser
		view to see how these changes were implemented. After some trial and error, I
		got a good sense of what the basic properties do and how to use them to garner
		the results I'm after.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I didn't run into any major problems or stopping-blocks doing this lab, I
		struggled a bit with styling my image as I had to figure out how to style both
	 	the div id and img element separately while making them work in harmony. After
	 	reading W3 School's page on the div tag I understood that the div acts as a
		container for the image which can then be styled in relation to its container.</p>

	<div id="photo">
		<img src="img/lab7_sunset.jpg" alt="alt"/>
	</div>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Upon completing this lab I now have an uploaded page for Lab7 and an
		understanding of basic CSS functions that I'll be able to implement to other
		labs and personal projects. One of the functions I learned was using viewport
		units and the max-width property to make my image size down in response to
		the size of the page, without getting larger than I want it to.</p>
