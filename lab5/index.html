			<p>In this lab we learned how to link to websites and other HTML documents
			stored in different places within the hierarchy. Part of this was creating
			a link within an image by wrapping an image tag within a hypertext reference
			(href) tag. We also learned to properly test our code before uploading it
			to GitHub making sure all images and links appear and work.</p>

			<p>Like a lizard, I was able to solve my problems using flexible thinking,
			trying methods I had not used before. My main issue was with linking to my
			cst251/index.html site, at first I thought my link wasn't working because
			I had referenced the wrong path but when that didn't work I decided to try
			something different. I went to "view in browser" and inspected the link being
			produced when I noticed a quotation mark had been added at the end. I
			deleted and retyped the line of code exactly the same way as before and the
			issue went away. I still don't know what caused the quotation to be added.</p>

			<p>This lab produced a webpage with functioning links, including several
			linked images, and taught us the importance of testing our code before
			uploading it to GitHub. Because I properly tested my code I know that my
			links all work and that my images appear how I want them to on the page.</p>
