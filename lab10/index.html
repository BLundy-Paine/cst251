		<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
		<p>The biggest challenge of this lab was choosing which fonts to use, what
		would look good together, serif or sans-serif. Along with choosing the font
		figuring out what spacing, font-weight, and style looked best.</p>

		<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
		<p>We didn't run into any problems with this lab. Due to our experience with
		previous labs we feel confident with these concepts.</p>

		<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
		<p>This lab resulted in an uploaded lab9 page styled with well-organized CSS
		and Google fonts. We also were able to update our homepage with a better font
		selection.</p>
