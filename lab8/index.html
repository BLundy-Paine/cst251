		<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
		<p>What I found the most challenging about this lab was learning how to use
		CSS selectors to refer to specific HTML elements. I thought I understood the
		difference between a space and no space until I went to put it in practice.</p>

		<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
		<p>I had problems with aligning my image and headings next to eachother, my
		image kept aligning to the bottom of my page and I didn't understand why but
		I soon realized it was because I had put it at the bottom of my div instead
		of at the top.</p>

		<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
		<p>Upon completion of this lab we now have an uploaded lab8 page with an image
		that zooms on hover as well as a better understanding of CSS properties and
		conventions. I can do a lot more now that I know how to group together different
		elements or style individual elements within one div differently.</p>
