		<p>My name is Benjamin and I think baking is the best hobbie, because
		when you're finished you get a delicious treat. It is also a great opportunity
		to share something enjoyable with those you love!</p>
		<p>Many of my memories growing up include sitting on my kitchen counter
		making cookies with my mom, who didn't cook that often. The Quaker oatmeal
		canister would come down and we'd make the classic "Vanishing Oatmeal Cookies",
		sub chocolate chips for the raisins. Those cookies would be enjoyed for days
		until my dad would inevitably eat them in the night.</p>
		<p>Try making them yourself to warm your heart and soul.</p>
