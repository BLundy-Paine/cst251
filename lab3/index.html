			<h2 class="subhead">Subject of this Lab</h2>
			<p>This lab detailed the importance of file structure in HTML and the
				difference between files and folders/directories. By keeping an organized
				file structure you can easily refer to elements in other folders such as
				images and CSS stylesheets.</p>

			<h2 class="subhead">Difficulties Faced</h2>
			<p>While completing this lab my partner and I had difficulties remembering
			the conventions around naming and nesting tags and frequently had to "view
			in browser" to check if issues were resolved. One issue was around linking
			to an image in a file, by looking at the examples given in the powerpoint
			it became apparent that the "src" information had been mistyped, after
			correcting the error the issue was fixed.</p>

		<div class="content">
			<h2 class="subhead">Our Results</h2>
			<p>Our results show organized code that led to a functioning page with
			viewable images and clickable links. Through freecodecamp we figured out
			how to open links in a new tab by adding "target='_blank'" after the link.
