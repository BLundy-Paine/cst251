		<h2>Benjamin Lundy-Paine</h3>
		<h3>Some Fun Facts About Me</h3>
		<p>My second great-granduncle Haven Gillespie, born in 1888, wrote the Christmas
		classic <i>Santa Claus is Coming to Town</i> in around 1933. Gillespie famously
		wrote the lyrics on the back of an envelope, while traveling on the NY subway,
		in only 15 minutes. His songs went on to be performed by many of the greats
		including Bruce Springsteen, Duke Ellington, and Frank Sinatra. I'd like to say
		that I inherited some of my great-granduncle's musical talent, but I am less of
		a lyrical genius and more the type to enjoy the musical talents of others.</p>
		<p>My family has always been very artistic, my parents ran a theatre company
		while I was growing up and my sibling went to NYU Tisch for acting.The first
		thirteen years of my life were spent in and around plays, from Shakespeare camps
		to a two year stint at Oakland School for the Arts, I thought acting was my future.
		Unfortunately, the pressure around looks, lines, and success was crushing for me,
		and the people of the theatre world are some of the most pompous I've ever met.
		One day I'd like to be in just one more play, to get to play the type of role I
		always wanted but never got â€” the comedic side character.</p>

			<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
			<p>The challenging part of this lab was getting both the sidebar and main
			content to sit nicely together even on a small screen. At first the main
			content kept getting way too small and it took awhile to figure out what
			width and min-widths would give the desired effect.</p>

			<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
			<p>The sticky position attribute seemed simple enough at first until it started
			disappearing halfway through scrolling down the page. Through searching the
			code and referencing W3 schools, it became apparent that it was being cut off
			by the size of its parent element. This was fixed by setting a height bigger
			than required for the content div.</p>

			<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
			<p>This lab resulted in an uploaded lab10 page styled using positioning such
			as sticky and relative as well as a navigational bar and sidebar. We now
			have a better understanding of how to position elements where we want them
			using several different positioning attributes. We also can now add sidebars
			and menus to enhance our pages.</p>
