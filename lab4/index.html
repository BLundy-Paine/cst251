		<h1>Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>
		<div id="Subject">
			<h2>Subject of this Lab</h2>
			<p>This lab is about uploading files to the GitHub server to make them
			available to view outside of our local repositories. We learned to test
			our html files in browser and correct any issues before commiting our
		 	changes to the master in GitHub Desktop. We can then view these files at
			our GitHub links.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Difficulties">
			<h2>Difficulties Faced</h2>
			<p>My partner helped me figure out how to commit multiple changes to the
			master in GitHub desktop by adding a summary which is required when uploading
			multiple files.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Results">
			<h2>Our Results</h2>
			<p>My partner and I both now know how to properly commit changes to the
			master and have our labs uploaded to our GitHub repositories which we can
			view on the web and send the link out for others to view.</p>
