		<p>Hi! My name is Benjamin (or Ben), I love living here in Monterey because
			I can go to the beach whenever I want! The beaches here are paradise
			compared to Alameda where I grew up, we have a man-made bay water beach
			that is not the most pleasant or warm. Here you can go out and see the
			seals without the frigid wind of San Francisco, and there are some beautiful
			birds to watch as well.</p>
		<p>My major is SBS and my minor/concentration is communication design. I'm
			excited to learn about HTML, CSS and other website building skills so I
			can share sociological knowledge through the internet. Research is often
			inaccesable due to paywalls and overly technical language and I hope I
			am able to remove some of those barriers. I think the world would be a
			better place if education were more accesible.</p>
