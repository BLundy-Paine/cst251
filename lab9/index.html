		<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
		<p>The most challenging aspect of this lab was figuring out what things I should
		put in divs to help style them and what things could be styled without a div.
		When my code wasn't working I used the inspector tool on Chrome and quickly
		found that I had referred incorrectly to the element.</p>

		<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
		<p>The problem we ran into with this lab was in setting a background image.
		I wanted my image to be responsive, expanding and collapsing as the page size
		changed without repeating or zooming. We attempted to use just the background-image
		and background-repeat properties, but it just zoomed in on one area. I decided
		to Google it and found a great article on Web FX that helped immensely.</p>

		<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
		<p>This lab resulted in us figuring out how to use the background-image property
		in CSS to make a responsive image. I also now feel like I understand the difference
	 	between having a space or no space in between selectors. We ended up with a
		well functioning lab page that helped us learn how to style and understand
		block elements.</p>
