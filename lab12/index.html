			<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
			<p>The biggest challenge of this lab was figuring out how to place my grave
			(task x) image under my zombie (center-both) image. At first I tried to center
			the grave the same way as the zombie with just one div, but realized the
			initial div that resized the image needed another div around it to correctly
			orient it's position on the page rather than around the image.</p>

<div id="center-img">
	<img src="img/lab12_center_img.png" alt="Halloween Candy"/>
</div>

			<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
			<p>During this lab we had problems with positioning the center-both image
			so that it was actually centered. Due to the image's transparent background,
			it's actual width was different than it's appearance so the "left" and "top"
			percentages needed a slight adjustment from 50%.</p>

<div id="center-horz">
	<h3>What mysteries can we resolve??</h3>
</div>

			<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
			<p>This lab resulted in an uploaded lab12 page with three main elements
			each taking up 30% of the screen, and each image and special text centered
			in their respective areas. We now have a good understanding of how to center
			elements both wthin their containers and in realtion to the page.</p>
